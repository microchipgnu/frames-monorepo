# frame curation MCP v0.0.1

First published version. Nine tools (`add_entity`, `set_fact`, `set_facts`,
`add_entity_with_facts`, `deprecate_fact`, `attach_evidence`, `remove_entity`,
`query`, `project`) and six read-only resources. Mutations are atomic. Source
required on every write.

The MCP server is the engine. Every mutation to a frame goes through it. Agents (Claude Code, OpenCode, agent-os, native loops) call typed tools; the server enforces invariants and appends events to `events.ndjson`.

This document is the contract. An implementation that doesn't expose exactly these tools with these signatures and these enforced invariants is non-conformant.

## How a frame exposes itself

`frame serve <name>` starts an MCP server pointed at the frame directory. The server speaks MCP over stdio (default) or HTTP (`--transport http`). The agent harness configures the MCP server URL/command in its own way.

A single frame directory has exactly one MCP server instance at a time. The server holds a write lock at `.frame/lock` for the duration of any mutation; concurrent mutation attempts fail.

## The six tools

Mutation tools — these append events:

### `add_entity`

Create a new entity. Required before `set_fact` on it.

```typescript
input: {
  entity_id?: string  // optional; if omitted, a slug-shaped UUID is generated
}
output: {
  entity_id: string
}
```

Errors:
- `EntityExists` — the entity_id already exists
- `InvalidEntityId` — entity_id doesn't match `[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]*`

### `set_fact`

Set a field's value on an entity with required source. Last-write-wins by ts for `(entity_id, field)`.

```typescript
input: {
  entity_id: string,
  field: string,
  value: any,         // type checked against schema.yml
  source: Source,     // see PROTOCOL.md — url + retrieved_at required
  confidence?: number, // 0..1
  observed_at?: string // ISO 8601
}
output: {
  fact_id: string  // for later deprecation or evidence-attachment
}
```

Errors:
- `EntityNotFound`
- `UnknownField` — field not in schema.yml (unless schema.allow_unknown_fields is true)
- `TypeMismatch` — value type doesn't match field type
- `MissingSource` — source.url or source.retrieved_at absent
- `InvalidConfidence` — confidence not in [0, 1]

### `deprecate_fact`

Mark a previously-set fact as no longer trusted. Projection reverts to the most recent non-deprecated fact for that (entity, field), or unsets.

```typescript
input: {
  fact_id: string,
  reason: string  // required, human-readable
}
output: {
  ok: true
}
```

Errors:
- `FactNotFound`
- `AlreadyDeprecated`
- `MissingReason`

### `attach_evidence`

Add an additional source to an existing fact without changing the value.

```typescript
input: {
  fact_id: string,
  source: Source
}
output: {
  ok: true
}
```

Errors:
- `FactNotFound`
- `MissingSource`

Read-only tools — these never append events:

### `query`

Read the current state of the frame.

```typescript
input:
  | { mode: "entity", entity_id: string }
  | { mode: "all" }
  | { mode: "sql", sql: string }     // read-only SQL against the SQLite index
  | { mode: "field", field: string, value?: any }  // entities matching a field value
output: {
  rows: Row[]      // one row per matching entity
  total: number
}
```

Errors:
- `EntityNotFound` (mode=entity)
- `InvalidSQL` (mode=sql; rejected if it contains writes)

### `project`

Force regeneration of the SQLite index and `rows.ndjson` from `events.ndjson`. Idempotent. Called automatically after every mutation; can be invoked manually after external edits to events.ndjson (which should be rare).

```typescript
input: {}
output: {
  entity_count: number,
  fact_count: number,
  deprecated_count: number,
  invalid_row_count: number,
  duration_ms: number
}
```

## Resources (read-only)

| URI | content |
|---|---|
| `frame://schema` | the parsed `schema.yml` |
| `frame://readme` | the `README.md` content |
| `frame://changelog` | the `CHANGELOG.md` content |
| `frame://recent-events` | the last 100 lines of `events.ndjson`, parsed |
| `frame://rows` | the current rows projection (NDJSON) |
| `frame://stats` | counts (entities, facts, deprecated facts, runs) |

## Invariants the server enforces

These are why the MCP server exists. An agent harness can be replaced; the server holds the line:

1. **Schema validation at write time.** `set_fact` validates `value` against the field's type before appending. Invalid writes are rejected with `TypeMismatch`.
2. **Source required.** No `set_fact` without a source object containing at least `url` and `retrieved_at`.
3. **Entity existence.** `set_fact` and `attach_evidence` require the entity to exist.
4. **Atomicity.** Each tool call results in exactly one event appended (or zero, on error). No partial writes.
5. **Append-only.** The server never modifies or removes existing lines from `events.ndjson`.
6. **Lock discipline.** The server holds `.frame/lock` for the duration of every mutation. Concurrent calls serialize.
7. **Projection consistency.** After every mutation, the SQLite index is updated synchronously. `query` always reflects post-mutation state.
8. **Deprecate-not-delete.** No tool deletes events. `entity.removed` and `fact.deprecated` are the only "removal" semantics.

## Errors

All errors return:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "FactNotFound",
    "message": "No fact with id ... exists",
    "details": { ... }   // optional, type-specific
  }
}
```

Error codes are stable strings. New codes can be added in minor versions; existing codes don't change meaning.

## What the server does NOT do

The frame MCP is a **curation surface**, not a runtime. The following are deliberately out of scope and live one layer up, in the *runtime configuration* (the agent harness, the local CLI, or Frames Cloud):

- **Scheduling, refresh, freshness.** No `tick`, no `schedule`. The runtime decides when to invoke the agent and how often.
- **Tool calls to external providers.** No `search`, `fetch`, `extract`. The agent harness uses its own tools (or its own MCP-bridged tools) and writes the result to the frame via `set_fact` with a source. The frame records what the runtime claims; verification is upstream.
- **Wallets, payments, x402/MPP.** The frame never holds a wallet, never debits, never tracks balances. Payment is a runtime concern: the harness pays for its tool calls and inference via whatever rails it's configured with (OWS for the canonical Frames runtime). The frame's job is to record sourced facts, not to fund their acquisition.
- **Inference credentials.** The frame doesn't know which model is reasoning over it. Model selection, API keys, and inference billing live with the harness.
- **Multi-frame composition.** No cross-frame queries. Future versions may add `frame://refs/<other-frame>/...` resources, but `query` is single-frame.
- **Authentication.** The server trusts whoever connects. AuthN/AuthZ is the responsibility of the transport layer (e.g., HTTP middleware) or the calling harness.
- **Streaming, real-time subscriptions.** Reads are point-in-time. Subscriptions can be added later as a minor-version extension.

This boundary is what makes the same frame portable across runtimes: a frame curated locally with your own wallet and tool keys is byte-identical to a frame curated by Frames Cloud with managed wallets and a federated catalog. Only the runtime configuration differs.

## Versioning

Same semver discipline as PROTOCOL.md. The MCP server announces its version in its initialization handshake. Clients should refuse to operate against unknown major versions.
